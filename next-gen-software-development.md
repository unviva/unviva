This article defines set of principles for next generation software development. It would require introduction of new kind composers/interpreters with a new understanding.

# Isolation
Code changes doesn't affect the code not being worked on.
When a component proven to be working, it works forever. Unless the component itself modified.

# Story Mode
Application flows in a story mode, rather than "if/else"s or loops. Each story has it's own seperate file.

As an example, a user wants to visit profiles of other users, follows the 'profile' story, which includes sub-stories in the same file. such as 'like, message' etc.

Of which main purpose is to prevent bugs.

# Detached from Properiarity and Rights
Rather than tens of 1000s apps for the same purpose, single or few apps that does the job, globally. Which would be free of ownership. But rather runs with project management.
