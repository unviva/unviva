# Isolation
Code changes doesn't affect the code not being worked on.
When a component proven to be working, it works forever. Unless the component itself modified.

# Story Mode
Application flows in a story mode, rather than "if/else"s.
As an example, a user wants to visit profiles of other users, follows the 'profile' story mode, which includes sub-stories such as 'like, message' etc.
Of which main purpose is to prevent bugs.
